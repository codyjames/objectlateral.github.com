The Proverbs say that a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, so I was quite excited when I obtained ObjectLateral.com from the gracious guys at [Bocoup][bocoup].

What does it mean? Nothing concrete, that's for sure.

It's a combination of [Object Literal][object-literal] (a foundational building block in object-oriented software) and [Lateral thinking][lateral-thinking] (solving problems using creative or indirect approaches).

I came up with this name on my own, but I was not the first one. Back in 2009, Rick Waldron and Boaz Sender wrote an entire joke library called ObjectLateral.js after a fortunate typo in the jQuery Conf program (Boaz has the details [here][bocoup-ol-blog]).
